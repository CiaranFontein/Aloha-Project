### JavaScript Functionalities

Check for strict equality with comparison operators
Implement a mobile-first responsive layout
Optimize layout for important device resoluton breakpoints

### Stretch Goals

Update the cart icon in the top-right corner of the header every time the user clicks the “Add to Cart” button for a product
Incorporate a fixed header at the top of the page so that the navigation menu is always visible when the user scrolls down the page

## More Stretches

Carousel is loaded via external js file with an array of all the products data and sources
Categories are organized and layed out incorporating a flex-grid
Headings are seperated via external js file so that the last word in the h1 tags in the html file will be styled differently instead of creating a new span inbetween each h1

## Meticulous CSS Formatting from Header to Footer
